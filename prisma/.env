# Placeholder fallback so `prisma generate` succeeds in environments where
# DATABASE_URL has not been provisioned yet (for example during Vercel builds
# that run before secrets are injected). Replace this with your real connection
# string in production or set the DATABASE_URL/POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL environment
# variable.
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://placeholder:placeholder@localhost:5432/placeholder"
