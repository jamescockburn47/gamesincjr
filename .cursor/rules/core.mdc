# GamesIncJr Project Rules
AlwaysApply: true

Context:
This is a no-code style Next.js site to showcase and sell AI-generated games (father + son project). Keep code minimal, readable, and educational.

Constraints:
- Framework: Next.js App Router (TypeScript).
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui ONLY.
- Data source: src/data/games.json (no DB unless explicitly requested).
- Demos: iframe HTML builds from /public/demos/<slug>/index.html.
- Images: /public/games/<slug>/...
- Do NOT add extra dependencies, state managers, analytics, or scaffolding without being asked.
- Keep components short, typed, accessible (semantic HTML, labels, alt text).
- Mobile-first responsive layout. Avoid heavy client JS; prefer server components.
- Keep file tree stable; when adding files, explain the change in 1â€“2 lines.
- Minimise bundle size; no unnecessary abstractions.

When I ask for features:
- Modify only the necessary files.
- Show a brief summary of changes (files touched + purpose).
- If a new dependency is truly required, ask for approval first and justify.
