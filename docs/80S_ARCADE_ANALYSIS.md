## How to Apply 80s Flavor Without Override

When user selects:
- **Game Type: "space"** → Make it Space Invaders-like (waves, formations)
- **Art Style: "pixel"** → Ensure blocky sprites, simple shapes
- **Colors: "dark-neon"** → Use bright neon on black (authentic arcade)
- **Speed: 5/5** → Make it frantic like Robotron
- **Difficulty: 3/5** → Moderate like Galaga

But ALSO apply 80s patterns:
- Add wave formations even if not specified
- Ensure colors feel arcade-authentic
- Make geometry recognizable and simple
- Add scoring multipliers for combos
- Include sound feedback on every action
- Implement clear progression levels
- Use simple collision patterns

## Arcade Game DNA

Every successful 80s arcade game had these:

1. **Simple Core Mechanic** - One thing you do (shoot, move, collect)
2. **Clear Victory Condition** - Beat the wave, reach the top, get the high score
3. **Instant Feedback** - Know immediately if you succeeded/failed
4. **Addictive Loop** - Want to play one more time
5. **Skill Expression** - High score comes from player skill
6. **Fair Difficulty** - Never feels cheap, always "one more try"
7. **Pixel-Perfect Arcade Feel** - Responsive, snappy, precise
8. **Visual Clarity** - Always know what's enemy, what's collectible, what's hazard
9. **Satisfying Destruction** - Points on impact, visual confirmation
10. **Progress Tracking** - Wave counter, level counter, score tracker visible

## Implementation Guide

Apply this analysis to game generation by:

1. **Map user choices to arcade patterns**
   - Game type + user preferences → arcade pattern
   - Difficulty/speed → enemy wave speeds
   - Art style → color/sprite approach

2. **Enhance prompt with 80s-specific guidance**
   - Wave formations if it makes sense
   - Arcade scoring systems (100, 500, 1000 points)
   - Simple geometric sprites
   - Bright color schemes
   - Responsive controls
   - Clear progression

3. **Preserve user agency**
   - User's color choice is respected
   - User's art style is baseline
   - User's difficulty guides pacing
   - User's game type determines theme
   - 80s flavor is sauce, not override

4. **Inject arcade authenticity**
   - Score increments (10, 50, 100, 500 points)
   - Wave/level systems
   - Lives counter (typically 3)
   - Escalating difficulty formula
   - Sound feedback patterns
   - Pixel-style sprite recommendations
