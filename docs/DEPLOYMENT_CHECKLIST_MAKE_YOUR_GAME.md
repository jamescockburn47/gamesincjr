## ⚠️ **Pre-Deployment Requirements**

### 1. Environment Variables (CRITICAL)
Add these to Vercel:

```bash
# Add DIRECT_URL for Prisma migrations
vercel env add DIRECT_URL production
# Enter: postgres://user:pass@host/db (NO ?pgbouncer=true)

# Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY exists
vercel env ls
# Should show: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, DATABASE_URL, DIRECT_URL
```

### 2. Database Migration (CRITICAL)
Run these commands:

```bash
# Generate Prisma client with new enum types
npx prisma generate

# Push schema changes to database
npx prisma db push

# Verify the changes
npx prisma studio
# Check GameSubmission.status is now SubmissionStatus enum
```

Expected changes:
- New `SubmissionStatus` enum (PENDING, BUILDING, REVIEW, APPROVED, REJECTED, LIVE)
- New composite index on `[creatorEmail, createdAt]`
- Updated `status` field type

### 3. Test API Endpoint

```bash
# Test the generation endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/games/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "creatorName": "Test User",
    "creatorEmail": "test@example.com",
    "gameTitle": "Test Space Game",
    "gameDescription": "A fun space adventure for testing",
    "gameType": "space",
    "difficulty": 3,
    "speed": 3,
    "lives": 3,
    "colors": "colorful",
    "artStyle": "cartoon",
    "background": "space",
    "movement": "four-way",
    "specialAction": "shoot",
    "collectibles": ["stars", "coins"],
    "hazards": ["asteroids", "enemies"],
    "features": ["power-ups"]
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "submissionId": "cm1x2y3z...",
  "status": "building",
  "estimatedTime": 300
}
```

### 4. Test Status Endpoint

```bash
# Check submission status
curl https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/games/status/[submissionId]
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "submissionId": "cm1x2y3z...",
  "status": "building",  // or "review", "approved", etc.
  "progress": 50,
  "createdAt": "2025-10-22T...",
  "gameTitle": "Test Space Game"
}
```

```

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin master
```

### Step 3: Monitor Vercel Deployment
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your Games Inc Jr project
3. Watch the deployment progress
4. Check build logs for any errors

Expected output:
```
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages
✓ Finalizing page optimization
```

### Step 4: Verify Environment Variables
In Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
2. Verify these exist:
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - `DATABASE_URL`
   - `DIRECT_URL` (NEW)
   - `ADMIN_EMAIL` (if applicable)

### Step 5: Run Database Migration on Production
```bash
# Option 1: Use Vercel CLI
vercel env pull .env.production
npx prisma db push --skip-generate

# Option 2: Trigger via API (if you have admin endpoint)
# OR manually run in Vercel's serverless function
```

### Step 6: Test in Production
Visit: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/make-your-game`

**Test Checklist:**
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] Form renders correctly
- [ ] All form fields are functional
- [ ] Submit button works
- [ ] Error messages display correctly
- [ ] Success screen shows after submission
- [ ] Submission ID is generated
- [ ] Email validation works
- [ ] Character counters update
- [ ] Selection limits work (4 collectibles, 4 hazards, 3 features)

### Step 7: Test Full Flow
1. Fill out form completely
2. Submit game request
3. Check database for submission (Prisma Studio)
4. Wait 3-5 minutes
5. Check status endpoint
6. Verify status changed to "review"
7. Check generated code in database

## 📊 **Monitoring & Observability**

### Database Queries to Run
```sql
-- Check recent submissions
SELECT id, status, gameTitle, creatorEmail, createdAt
FROM game_submissions
ORDER BY createdAt DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check status distribution
SELECT status, COUNT(*)
FROM game_submissions
GROUP BY status;

-- Check rate limiting (submissions today)
SELECT creatorEmail, COUNT(*) as count
FROM game_submissions
WHERE createdAt >= CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY creatorEmail
ORDER BY count DESC;

-- Check failed submissions
SELECT id, gameTitle, reviewNotes
FROM game_submissions
WHERE status = 'REJECTED'
ORDER BY createdAt DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Logs to Monitor
Watch Vercel logs for:
```
[Game Generator] Starting generation for: [id]
[Game Generator] Claude responded, extracting HTML...
[Game Generator] Tokens used: [usage object]
[Game Generator] Code validated, generating assets...
[Game Generator] ✓ Complete! Status: review
```

Error patterns to watch:
```
[Moderation] Error: [reason]
[Game Generator] ERROR: [error]
[Validation] Missing [element]
[Validation] Code too short: [bytes]
```

---

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### Issue: "Module not found: @prisma/client"
**Solution:** Run `npx prisma generate` locally and redeploy

### Issue: "SubmissionStatus is not exported"
**Solution:**
1. Run `npx prisma generate`
2. Restart TypeScript server
3. Verify `node_modules/.prisma/client` contains enum

### Issue: "directUrl is required"
**Solution:** Add `DIRECT_URL` environment variable to Vercel

### Issue: "Too many connections"
**Solution:** Prisma singleton is working, but check connection string has `?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1`

### Issue: "AI generation timeout"
**Solution:**
- Check ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is valid
- Check Claude API status
- Retry logic should handle transient failures (3 attempts)

### Issue: "Content moderation failed"
**Solution:**
- Check error logs
- Moderation now fails closed (rejects on error)
- User sees "temporarily unavailable" message

---

## 📈 **Success Metrics**

Track these KPIs:
- **Submission Rate**: Games submitted per day
- **Success Rate**: Submissions reaching "review" status
- **Failure Rate**: Submissions rejected by validation or moderation
- **Generation Time**: Average time from "building" to "review"
- **User Retention**: Users creating multiple games

Targets:
- 95%+ success rate (building → review)
- <5 minute average generation time
- 0% database connection errors
- 0% timeout errors (with retry logic)

---

## 🎯 **Post-Deployment Tasks**

### Immediate (Day 1)
- [ ] Monitor first 10 submissions
- [ ] Check all logs for errors
- [ ] Verify email rate limiting works
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness

### Short-term (Week 1)
- [ ] Implement admin email notifications
- [ ] Add user email notifications
- [ ] Create admin review dashboard
- [ ] Add telemetry/analytics

### Medium-term (Month 1)
- [ ] Add CAPTCHA to prevent abuse
- [ ] Implement IP-based rate limiting
- [ ] Add game preview in review stage
- [ ] Create automated testing suite

---

## 📝 **Known Limitations**

1. **No admin notification system** - Admins must manually check database
2. **No user notifications** - Users don't know when their game is ready
3. **Race condition in rate limiting** - Multiple concurrent requests from same email could bypass limit
4. **No CAPTCHA** - Vulnerable to automated submissions
5. **No IP-based rate limiting** - Users can bypass email limit with different emails
